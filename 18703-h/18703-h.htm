<h3>ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE OF THE COLLECTIONS OBTAINED FROM THE INDIANS
OF NEW MEXICO IN 1880.</h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h4 class = "smallcaps">By James Stevenson.</h4>

<hr class = "tiny">

<h4 class = "chapter">INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>
It is thought best that I should give, in connection with the catalogue
of collections made by the party under my charge in 1880-&rsquo;81,
a&nbsp;brief statement in relation to the collections described in the
catalogues, and the information obtained in regard to the Pueblo
tribes.</p>

<p>
Our explorations during the field season of 1880 and 1881 were
restricted to the Pueblo tribes located along the Rio Grande and its
tributaries in New Mexico. The chief object in view was to secure as
soon as possible all the ethnological and archaeological data obtainable
before it should be lost to science by the influx of civilized
population which is being rapidly thrown into this region by the
extension of railroads into and through it. Not only are the
architectural remains being rapidly destroyed and archaeological
specimens collected and carried away by travelers, excursionists, and
curiosity hunters, but the ancient habits and customs of these tribes
are rapidly giving way and falling into disuse before the influence of
eastern civilization.</p>

<p>
Our party, consisting, besides myself, of Mr. Galbraith, archaeologist,
Mr. Morancy, assistant, and Mr. J.&nbsp;K. Hillers, photographer,
proceeded to Santa Fé, N.&nbsp;Mex., where an outfit was secured for the
season&rsquo;s work. From here we proceeded to Taos, one of the most
extensive pueblos in the Rio Grande region. This village is situated on
the Rio Taos a few miles from the Rio Grande, and just under the shadow
of the Taos Mountains. It comprises two large sections, one on each side
of the Rio Taos. These are compactly built and each six stories high.
The industrial pursuits of these Indians are principally pastoral and
agricultural, they having a good market for their products in the
Mexican village of Fernandez de Taos, containing a population of about
4,000 Mexicans and eastern people.</p>

<p>
The party spent several days here making investigations and collections.
The collection made was small but quite varied and novel, though few of
the articles obtained were of their own manufacture.</p>

<p>
Quite a number of stone implements were secured, among which
<!--png 816-->
<span class = "pagenum">430</span>
<a name = "page430"> </a>
were some stone knives, pipes, a number of rude stone axes and hammers,
arrow smoothers, &amp;c. The pottery obtained here is chiefly of the
common type and resembles that from San Juan, from whence in all
probability it was received by exchange and barter. Earthenware, so far
as I can learn, is not now made in Taos, except by a few families where
a Taos Indian has married a woman from San Juan or some other tribe
where the manufacture of pottery is carried on. If this industry was
ever, practiced by the Taos Indians it must have been at a remote
period; in fact there seems to be no tradition of it now among them.</p>

<p>
From here we went next to the pueblo of San Juan, situated on the left
bank of the Rio Grande, about 50 miles south of Taos. At this pueblo a
collection was made of stone implements, articles of clay, &amp;c. These
specimens are not quite so representative as those from some of the more
southern pueblos, the village being situated on one of the military
wagon roads, over which many Europeans pass, and hence frequently
visited; many of the most valuable specimens of implements and pottery
have been bartered away; however, those we obtained display quite fully
all the industries of the people of this pueblo. This collection
consists of a number of fine stone mortars, pestles, arrow and spear
heads, also several polishing stones. Quite a number of small animal
forms carved out of stone were also secured. At this pueblo many
specimens of the black polished ware peculiar to a few of the tribes in
the Rio Grande Valley were collected.</p>

<p>
From San Juan we proceeded to Santa Clara, situated a few miles below on
the right bank of the Rio Grande. This pueblo proved to be so
interesting in its surroundings that some time was spent here in making
investigations. We found the people extensively engaged in the
manufacture of that black polished pottery of which so little has been
known heretofore, especially in regard to the process of baking and
coloring it, which is fully described in the text accompanying the
catalogue of last year in this volume. The larger portion of the
specimens of earthenware obtained here was of this kind, though several
specimens of the red and some few of the ornamented class were also
secured.</p>

<p>
Most of the pottery manufactured at this village is the black polished
ware. That of the decorated class is ornamented with the juice of
<i>Cleome integrifolia</i>, which is fixed in the ware in the process of
burning. Mineral substances, so far as I could learn, are not used by
the Indians of Santa Clara in decorating their pottery.</p>

<p>
Among the specimens are a number of interesting stone implements, nearly
all of an older kind than any made by this people at the present
day.</p>

<p>
During our stay at this pueblo some interesting archaeological
discoveries were made of which a brief mention in this connection may
not be out of place, and which will certainly prove of great interest to
future investigators. Between the Rio Grande and Valle Mountains,
commencing
<!--png 817-->
<span class = "pagenum">431</span>
<a name = "page431"> </a>
about 12 miles below, or south, of Santa Clara, and extending south, to
within ten miles of Cochití, a distance of about 65 miles, is an
extensive area, the intermediate elevated portion of which is composed
of a yellowish volcanic tufa, of coarse texture and sufficiently soft
and yielding to be readily worked or carved with rude stone implements.
Over this entire area there are irregular elevations, somewhat circular
in outline, from 50 to 200 feet in height, the faces of which have been
worn away by the elements, and are in nearly all instances
perpendicular. These consecutive elevations extend back from the Rio
Grande from five to fifteen miles. Over this whole expanse of country,
in the faces of these cliffs, we found an immense number of cavate
dwellings, cut out by the hand of man. We made no attempt to count the
number of these curious dwellings, dug like hermit cells out of the
rock, but they may be estimated with safety among the thousands. I made
many inquiries of the neighboring tribes in regard to the history of
these dwellings, but could elicit no information from any of them. The
response was invariably, &ldquo;they are very old and the people who
occupied them are gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
An inspection of a portion of this area revealed a condition of things
which I have no doubt prevails throughout. The dwellings were found in
the faces of the cliffs, about 20 feet apart in many instances, but the
distances are irregular. A careful examination satisfied me that they
were excavated with rude stone implements resembling adzes, numbers of
which were found here, and which were probably used by fastening one end
to a handle.</p>

<p>
The doorways, which are square, were first cut into the face of the wall
to a depth of about one foot, and then the work of enlarging the room
began. The interiors of the rooms are oval in shape, about 12 feet in
diameter, and only of sufficient height to enable one to stand
upright.</p>

<p>
The process, from the evidences shown inside, of carving out the
interior of the dwelling was by scraping grooves several inches deep and
apart, and breaking out the intermediate portion; in this way the work
progressed until the room reached the desired size. Inside of these
rooms were found many little niches and excavated recesses used for
storing household ornaments, the larger ones probably supplying the
place of cupboards. Near the roofs of many of the caves are mortises,
projecting from which, in many instances, were found the decayed ends of
wooden beams or sleepers, which were probably used, as they are now in
the modern Pueblo dwellings, as poles over which to hang blankets and
clothing, or to dry meat. These dwellings were without fireplaces; but
the evidences of fire were plainly visible at the side of each cave, and
in none of those visited did we find any orifice for the egress of the
smoke but the small doorway. On the outside or in front of these
singular habitations are rows of holes mortised into the face of the
cliffs about the doors. It is quite evident that these were for the
insertion of beams of wood (for forming booths or shelters in the
front), as ends of
<!--png 818-->
<span class = "pagenum">432</span>
<a name = "page432"> </a>
beams were found sticking there, which, in their sheltered position and
in this dry climate, may have been preserved for centuries.</p>

<p>
Upon the top of the mesa of which these cliffs are the exposed sides we
found the ruins of large circular buildings made of square stones 8 by
12 inches in size. The walls of some of these structures remain standing
to the height of ten or twelve feet, and show that from four to five
hundred people can find room within each inclosure. One of these
buildings was rectangular and two were round structures. The latter were
about 100 and 150 feet in diameter, the rectangular one about 300 feet
square. Many small square rooms were constructed in the interior from
large cut bricks of the tufa of which the bluffs are composed. These
rooms all opened toward the center of the large inclosure, which has but
one general doorway. From these ruins we secured great quantities of
pottery, arrow and spear heads, knives, grinding-stones,
arrow-smoothers, and many of the small flint adzes, which were
undoubtedly used for making the blocks for the structures on the mesa
and for excavating the cave dwellings. Among the débris in the dwellings
are found corncobs and other evidences of the food used by the
inhabitants. This certainly indicates that the people who occupied these
singular dwellings were agricultural.</p>

<p>
The faces of some of the more prominent cliffs contained as many as
three rows of chambers one above the other; the débris at the foot,
sometimes 200 feet deep, covered up at least two rows of these
chambers.</p>

<p>
Along the edges of the cliffs and over the rocky surface of the mesa are
winding footpaths from 3 to 10 inches deep, worn by the feet of the
inhabitants. Some of these paths showed perceptible foot-prints where it
was inconvenient for those following the path to do otherwise than tread
in the footsteps of their predecessors.</p>

<p>
In our limited investigations we were unable to discover any evidence of
burial customs. No graves could be found, and nothing of human
remains.</p>

<p>
The southern portion of this area seems to have been most densely
populated. Some of the protected walls in the neighborhood retain
hieroglyphics in abundance. These resemble the picture writing of the
present Indians of that region. Many interesting specimens of the art of
this ancient people can be seen in the images of wild animals scattered
over various spots. Many of them are cut in full relief out of the tufa
and are always in some natural attitude, and can always be identified
where the weather has not destroyed the original form. The most
prominent are two mountain lions, side by side and life size.</p>

<p>
Further examinations will reveal much more of value and interest in
connection with this very inviting locality.</p>

<p>
Mr. Galbraith, who accompanied my party, spent some time examining this
region and made collections here.</p>

<p>
The next pueblo visited was San Ildefonso, about five miles below Santa
Clara, on the opposite bank of the Rio Grande. But few specimens
<!--png 819-->
<span class = "pagenum">433</span>
<a name = "page433"> </a>
were obtained here. The people of this pueblo devote their time chiefly
to agricultural and pastoral pursuits, and have almost abandoned the
manufacture of pottery, that in use by them at the present time being
mostly obtained from neighboring tribes.</p>

<p>
From San Ildefonso we proceeded to Nambé, a pueblo which has become
almost extinct. The remnant of this people is situated about 25 miles
above Ildefonso, on Nambé Creek, and not far from the base of the
mountains. The people of Nambé have several times in years past moved
their pueblo higher up the stream, the valley of which furnishes them
fine agricultural and grazing grounds. They make very little pottery,
but we found stored in many of the houses of the village great
quantities of stone implements, principally large metates and
grinding-stones. We also found many specimens of interest among the
ruins of old Nambé and Pojuaque, as well as the remains of pottery in
such quantities as to show that in the past the manufacture of pottery
had been carried on quite extensively. In this vicinity I made
arrangements with one of the employés of the party, who had resided many
years at Santa Fé, to make excavations and collections from the old
sites of Nambé, Pojuaque, and Cuyamunque, in which he was quite
successful.</p>

<p>
From the pueblos north of Santa Fé we traveled direct to Cochití, 27
miles southwest of Santa Fé. This village is situated on the right bank
of the Rio Grande and about three miles from Peña Blanca, a small
Mexican town opposite. Here a very interesting collection was secured
consisting mostly of pottery, many of the vessels simulating animal
forms, variously ornamented with representations of some varieties of
the flora of the locality. A few stone implements were also obtained
here.</p>

<p>
We next visited Jémez, situated on the Rio Jémez. From thence we went to
Silla and Santa Ana. At each of these villages representative
collections were made, all of which are referred to in detail in the
catalogue.</p>

<p>
The next villages visited were Santo Domingo and Sandia, on the Rio
Grande. Some characteristic specimens were obtained at each of these
pueblos. The method of their manufacture and the manner of using them
are generally the same as in most of the other pueblos.</p>

<p>
A small collection of rude stone hammers was obtained from the
<ins class = "correction" title =
"normal spelling for this publication">turquois</ins> mine in the
Cerrillo Mountains, about 25 miles from Santa&nbsp;Fé.</p>

<p>
The products of this celebrated mine, which were objects of traffic all
over New Mexico, as well as contiguous countries, probably formed one
inducement which led to the Spanish conquest of this region. The
turquoises from this mine have always been valued as ornaments by the
Indians of New Mexico, and carried far and wide for sale by them. The
mine was worked in a most primitive manner with these rude stone
hammers, a number of which were secured.
<!--png 820-->
<span class = "pagenum">434</span>
<a name = "page434"> </a>
The collections are all now in the National Museum for study and
inspection.</p>

<p>
The following sketch is introduced here to show the method of using the
batten stick represented in <ins class = "crossref" title =
"in companion article, 1879 Catalogue">Fig. 546</ins>.
There is not a family
among the Pueblos or Navajos that does not possess the necessary
implements for weaving blankets, belts and garters. <ins class =
"crossref" title = "in companion article, 1879 Catalogue">Figs.
500-502</ins> will convey an idea of the variety in design and coloring
which prevails in this class of Indian fabrics, while <a href =
"#fig710">Fig. 710</a> represents a blanket weaver at work. The picture
is taken from a photograph made on the spot by Mr. Hillers, and is
colored in accordance with the actual colors of the yarns and threads
used in its manufacture.</p>

<span class = "caption">Fig. 710. THE BLANKET WEAVER.</span></p>

<p>
The particular class of blankets represented in this illustration is
woven in the estufas, and is used almost exclusively in sacred dances
and ceremonies of the tribe, all other garments being made in the houses
or in the open air. The Navajos are celebrated for their skill as
blanket weavers, and the Mokis are equally skilled in the manufacture of
a finer class of the same article, which is much sought after by the
surrounding tribes for ornamental purposes in sacred and other
dances.</p>

<p>
The vertical threads, as shown in the figure, are the warp threads; the
coarser thread which is inserted transversely between these is the yarn
or weft. The three rods in the center of the blanket are lease rods,
which are introduced among the threads of the warp to separate them and
thus facilitate the insertion of the weft thread. These rods are each
passed in front of one warp thread and behind another, alternately,
across the whole warp, and between each rod the threads are brought from
the back of one to the front of the next, and <i>vice versa</i>. The bar
held in hands of the weaver serves as a batten for driving or beating
the weft thread into the angle formed by the crossed warp threads.</p>

<p>
This loom resembles in principle the ancient Egyptian, Grecian, and
French looms which are described on pages 55 to 62 of &ldquo;The History
and Principles of Weaving by Hand and Power,&rdquo; by A.&nbsp;Barlow,
London, 1878, and on pages 41 to 45 of the &ldquo;Treatise on Weaving
and Designing of Textile Fabrics,&rdquo; by Thomas E. Ashenhurst,
Bradford, England, 1881. See also pp. 200 to 208, Vol.&nbsp;II, of the
&ldquo;Cotton Manufacture of Great Britain,&rdquo; by A.&nbsp;Ure,

<h5>(Blackened by use on the fire; not polished.)</h5>

<p>
This ware, when first made and before use, varies in shade from dark
earth color to reddish-brown, but the soot, smoke, and fire, when in
use, soon darken it; hence it is usually described as black ware. The
articles are used for cooking purposes, such as pots&mdash;which are
usually pot-shaped&mdash;some without handles and some with a handle on
one side, bowls, &amp;c. The pots vary in capacity from a pint to a
little over a gallon.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
